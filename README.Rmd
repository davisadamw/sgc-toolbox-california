The goal of sgc-toolbox-california is to populate an EV Toolbox for California using adoption totals from the EPA Project / CARB Scenario with the Synthetic Population developed for "Couldnâ€™t Car Less: Where Will New Electric Cars, Trucks, and SUVs be Located? A Household-Level EV Adoption Model for California" ~ Trisha Ramadoss, Adam Davis, Gil Tal TRBAM-22-03706 .

# Inputs
- Synthetic Population for California
- Annual EV Ownership totals for all household categories / sizes

# Scripts included:
- 01_* Use synthetic population to convert statewide totals to Tract-level ownership totals
- 02_* Interpolate tract-level ownership totals
- 03_* Produce and interpolate tract-level commute info
- 04_* Any additional data prep needed for website, likely including spatial data prep
